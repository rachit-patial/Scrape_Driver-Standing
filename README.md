# Scrape_Driver-Standing
Web Scraping F1 Driver standing from the official site.

Made use of **PySide6** to make the GUI and **BeautifulSoup** to scrape for the data.

Currently it is fetching the points table by using scraping, the current leading racer and next track are still under development.

In future, thinking of adding Driver icons and teams in the table, also assigning color to rows according to the teams.
